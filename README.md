**** Draft for Project Overview

The Woof! Jacket has a water resistance rating of 50 meters under the ISO standard 22810:2010, meaning it may be used during light precipitation. The product is a textile, tailored, comfortable jacket capable of performing physical activity sensing in vivo. The jacket is composed of flexible multi-layer encapsulated sensor modules and microcontrollers. Specifically, it consists of a GPS module, a bluetooth low-energy (BLE) module, a cellular data module, and a microphone. The GPS module is a NEO-6M V2 that is connected to an ESP32 via jumper wires. The microphone is a IMNP-441 sensor that is connected to the ESP32 via jumper wires. The microphone data is collected once the Woof! Jacket comes in contact with another Woof! device’s BLE. Once the BLE received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is strong enough, microphone data is collected for the duration of the encounter. This audio data is collected via the IMNP-441 and is initially stored in the Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System (SPIFFS) of the ESP32. After collection, the audio data is sent directly to a Flask API that returns a prediction of the encounter. Following  this prediction, the application will then suggest that a user adds another user as a friend if the encounter was determined by the model to be “positive”. The data stored in SPIFFS is then deleted, so new microphone data may be collected for future interactions.
