# Senior_Design
Repository for storing code for our Senior Design Project:

This branch was utilized during first semester developing the backbone of what would become our Maps Component. 

Social media application that leverages information from dog-tag to make ”friend” recommendations

App.js is the sole component of the find my friends capability at the moment. It includes all code needed for front end development and connection to Scaledrone.

rand_moves.js and index.js are both files just for now to be able to show the capability of one connecting to a local server as well as displaying friends' locations, which for now consists of dummy data.
